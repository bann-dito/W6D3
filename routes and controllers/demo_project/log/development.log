ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError - We could not find your database: demo_project_development. Which can be found in the database configuration file located at config/database.yml.
To resolve this issue:
- Did you create the database for this app, or delete it? You may need to create your database.
- Has the database name changed? Check your database.yml config has the correct database name.
To create your database, run:

AbstractController::DoubleRenderError - Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".:
