ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError - We could not find your database: demo_project_development. Which can be found in the database configuration file located at config/database.yml.
To resolve this issue:
- Did you create the database for this app, or delete it? You may need to create your database.
- Has the database name changed? Check your database.yml config has the correct database name.
To create your database, run:
